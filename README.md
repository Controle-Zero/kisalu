## Local Development

**Warning**: This app is incompatible with the web. Only on Android and iOS.

**Note**: All commands that are written `android`, replace with `iOS` if you want to build or test on iOS

First of all, install the dependencies using the command below

```bash
npm install
```

### Emulator

Execute the app on the emulator with the command below

```bash
npm run android
```

Wait for the build to finish and for the emulator to open

### Physical Device

Execute the app with the command below

```bash
npm start
```

Wait for the QR code to appear and then scan it with your phone. Scan with Expo Go if you are on Android or scan it with the camera if you are on iOS.

If there is any issue with the build and execution with the app, please report on the <a href="https://github.com/Controle-Zero/kisalu/issues">issues</a>
